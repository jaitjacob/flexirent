# flexirent
A console application in the Java programming language which allows a company called FlexiRent to manage the renting and maintenance of various types of rental apartments in Melbourne CBD. Unlike traditional hotels, FlexiRent offers stylish 1, 2, and 3-bedroom Apartments and Premium Suites for short-term stays in Melbourne.

The objective of this project was to implement advance concepts learnt in Java. I was able to use the programming language in the implementation of small to medium sized application programs that  illustrate professionally acceptable coding and performance standards.
Also, I have attempted to demonstrate knowledge of the basic principles of the object oriented development process and apply this understanding to the analysis and design of solutions(in this case a rental system).


NOT MAINTAINED ANYMORE.
